System design refers to the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements. It involves designing the overall structure of a software or hardware system and the interactions between its different components to ensure that the system meets its intended functionality, performance, scalability, reliability, and other quality attributes.


System design typically involves the following steps:

Requirements Analysis: Understanding the requirements of the system and the needs of its stakeholders.

System Architecture Design: Defining the high-level structure of the system, including its components, their responsibilities, and how they interact with each other.

Database Design: If the system involves data storage, designing the database schema, data models, and access patterns.

User Interface Design: Designing the user interface elements and how users will interact with the system.

Component Design: Designing individual components or modules of the system, including their internal structure, interfaces, and interactions with other components.

Integration and Testing: Integrating the components together and testing the system as a whole to ensure that it meets the specified requirements.

Deployment and Maintenance: Deploying the system into production and maintaining it over time, including fixing bugs, adding new features, and handling changes in requirements.
